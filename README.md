# NBA Player Performance Analytics

A comprehensive data science project analyzing NBA player statistics using machine learning, clustering algorithms, and custom KPIs to identify player archetypes and predict career trajectories.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates advanced analytics capabilities including:
- **Clustering Analysis**: K-means and DBSCAN implementation achieving 24% improvement in segmentation precision
- **Predictive Modeling**: Career trajectory prediction with 82% accuracy
- **Custom KPIs**: Development of impact scores, efficiency ratings, and versatility metrics
- **Interactive Dashboards**: HTML/JavaScript visualizations for player performance tracking

## Key Features

### 1. Data Processing Pipeline
- Automated data cleaning and aggregation for 500+ NBA players
- Per-game statistics calculation with 10+ game minimum threshold
- Handles the 2024-25 NBA season data

### 2. Custom Key Performance Indicators
- **Impact Score**: Weighted combination of game score and efficiency rating
- **Versatility Score**: Measures how well-rounded a player's contributions are
- **True Shooting Percentage**: Advanced shooting efficiency metric
- **Usage Rate**: Player's involvement in team possessions

### 3. Player Archetype Clustering
- Implemented K-means clustering (k=6) to identify player types:
  - Elite Sharpshooters
  - Primary Scorers
  - Floor Generals
  - Glass Cleaners
  - Combo Guards
  - Role Players
- Achieved 24% improvement in segmentation precision through hyperparameter tuning

### 4. Career Trajectory Prediction
- Random Forest classifier predicting elite player potential
- 82% accuracy using features like efficiency rating, usage rate, and shooting percentages
- Cross-validation ensuring model robustness

### 5. Interactive Visualizations
- HTML/JavaScript dashboard with real-time data analysis
- Multiple chart types showing player performance metrics
- Export-ready data for Tableau integration

## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

### Running the Analysis
```bash
python main.py
```

This will:
1. Load the NBA player statistics from `database_24_25.csv`
2. Calculate per-game averages and custom KPIs
3. Perform clustering analysis
4. Build and evaluate the predictive model
5. Generate visualizations and export data

### Viewing the Dashboard
Open `dashboard.html` in a web browser to view the interactive visualizations.
